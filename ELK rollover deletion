ELK rollover deletion Steps::

In our ELK environment, when the storage utilization reaches the watermark flood stage exceeding 90%, Elasticsearch automatically enforces a read-only status on the indices. This action restricts access to log data in Kibana, leading to error messages.

Immediate Steps to Identify and Resolve Issues:

1. Check Storage Utilization:
    Execute the following command to assess disk usage:

    df -h

    Run this command on the ELK host to get an overview of the storage status.

2. Identify High Consumption Indices:
    Use the following API to examine individual index sizes, identifying which indices are consuming the most space:

        curl -X GET "<http://localhost:9200/_cat>/indices?v&s=store.size:desc"

         

                              Analyze the output to pinpoint indices with high space consumption.
                    
                              **Delete Unnecessary Indices:**
                              If you find indices holding onto old data and contributing to the storage issue, use the fo
                              llowing command to delete them:
                              ```bash
                              curl -X DELETE "localhost:9200/xxxxxxxxxx"  # Replace xxxxxxxxxx with the index name

   Example:
curl -X DELETE "localhost:9200/example_index"

   Deleting unnecessary indices frees up space and resolves the storage concern.

3. Verify Storage and ELK Log Access:
    After deleting indices, check the storage status and ensure access to ELK logs. Confirm that the issue is resolved. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Resetting Read-Only Indices (If Necessary):
    In case the problem persists, and indices remain in a read-only state, perform the following steps to reset them:

curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/xxxxxxxxxx/_settings" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"settings": {"index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete": null}}'

Example:
curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/example_index/_settings" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"settings": {"index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete": null}}'

Resetting read-only indices ensures normal data flow and access.
